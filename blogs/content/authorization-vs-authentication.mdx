# Authorization Vs Authentication

## What is Authentication? 

Authentication is a proof that the person accessing the route is you. In real terms you can also say 
its like a driver's licence or passport. 

## What is Authorization?

Authorization is like showing you have right access and permissions to the requested route. <br/>
**Example:** Only admin people have access to admin panel.


**Some types of authentication:** 

- Basic Auth.
- OAuth2.0 (Open Authentication)
- API Keys

### What is Basic Auth? 

This is the most common and simple type of authentication where the username and password are kept in the HTTP request headers itself.
This kinda method is the least preferred due to the lack of security and does not use any sessionID, cookies and stuff.

**Examples:**

> Usually the password isn't your actual password rather a personal token.
<p></P>

*Don't include `<` and `>`*

```
In Web Browsers:

url: https//:<username>:<password>@<url> should do the trick.
```

<p></p>

```
In Terminal:

$ curl -u <username>:<password> <url>
```

<p></p>

```
In Postman: 

- Go under Authorization tab under the url.
- Then select Type : Basic Auth, then you should see a new section popped up which shows username and password
- Enter the credentials and start making requests.

```
