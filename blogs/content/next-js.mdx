<h2> This is where I start. </h2>

To install next js, its pretty straight forward, just type 
`yarn create next-app` or `npx create-next-app` and for the typescript support just add the --typescript flag at the end and that should do it:). 

Once you successfully install nextjs on ur folder, you should see a complete different folder structure from the common create-react-app (CRA). 




Now let's look at what each folder does.  

**.next** is where nextjs keeps all the built content so its nothing for us to play with :). 

**node_modules** where we store our node modules, does what the names says.

**public** anything that is kept in that folder you can access it with url. suppose you have a image.png there. if you type, *domain/image.png* you will get there :). 

**styles** like the name sounds, just for putting your css/sass in a folder

**pages** This is where next js shines itself. In the pages folder, each of the file is given with its specific route. 
`Each file must have a default export so that component gets loaded on the url` 
Example: 
```
pages -|
       |-> about.tsx .
```
Now if we go to domain/about we should be able to see what the about.tsx is rendering. 
Note: All files in pages are preferred to be lowercase, especially index.tsx. Since these files are api routes, and by now you should know that api routes are always preferred to be in lowercased tho they can work uppercased as well.

*How do we do dynamic routing in nextJS?* 
example : domain/about/:pid. Its actually fairly simple in next js. 
```
 pages -> about -|
                 |-> index.tsx (main page), 
                 |-> [pid].tsx(dynamic routing) 
```
We will also get into dynamic routing as we go more in to the blog.

**In pages you should also see api folder** this is for the purpose of backend api calls. we will discuss this in the end. you can also use node & express as you backend instead of nextjs but its good to know it exists. 

**So why does nextJS outgo react?** 

Before we get into all this I also want to conclude that Next JS is react as well but with a new set of configured webpack settings so developers don't cry about the `Bundle size` in the production build and the time it takes to load on the page reload.

### How does nextjs handle bundle size in production? 

Instead of making one huge bundle, they make multiple separate bundles which belongs to specific route. So when a user requests for a page, they only get the JavaScript required for that page, By doing this we can overcome the time to takes to load content on the first load.

**For Example:** If a user is in route `about`, the server will only send the JavaScript module for that page. But in the react projects, when you load the project the server sends the entire bundle and it starts rendering in front of the client. This is why react projects take forever to load. 
So what people do is( For big application ), they do something called `code splitting` so that server doesn't send the entire module which could take minutes to load. Next js does this outta the box.

## Lets talk about the 3 different types of rendering. 

- Client Side Rendering 
- Static Site Generation
- Server Side Rendering 

### Client Side Generation? 

`If you are familiar with React, you should know it uses client side rendering.`

In this type of generation, the server sends the entire JavaScript to the client and in front of the client the page starts to render. 


### Static Site Generation? 

Like the name sounds this is used more with static sites which there isn't a need for building the site again and again.
