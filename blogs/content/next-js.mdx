<h2> This is where I start. </h2>

To install next js, its pretty straight forward, just type 
`yarn create next-app` or `npx create-next-app` and for the typescript support just add the --typescript flag at the end and that should do it:). 

Once you successfully install nextjs on ur folder, you should see a complete different folder structure from the common create-react-app (CRA). 




Now let's look at what each folder does.  

**.next** is where nextjs keeps all the built content so its nothing for us to play with :). 

**node_modules** where we store our node modules, does what the names says.

**public** anything that is kept in that folder you can access it with url. suppose you have a image.png there. if you type, *domain/image.png* you will get there :). 

**styles** like the name sounds, just for putting your css/sass in a folder

**pages** This is where next js shines itself. In the pages folder, each of the file is given with its specific route. 
`Each file must have a default export so that component gets loaded on the url` 
Example: 
```
pages -|
       |-> about.tsx .
```
Now if we go to domain/about we should be able to see what the about.tsx is rendering. 
Note: All files in pages are preferred to be lowercase, especially index.tsx. Since these files are api routes, and by now you should know that api routes are always preferred to be in lowercased tho they can work uppercased as well.

*How do we do dynamic routing in nextJS?* 
example : domain/about/:pid. Its actually fairly simple in next js. 
```
 pages -> about -|
                 |-> index.tsx (main page), 
                 |-> [pid].tsx(dynamic routing) 
```
We will also get into dynamic routing as we go more in to the blog.

**In pages you should also see api folder** this is for the purpose of backend api calls. we will discuss this in the end. you can also use node & express as you backend instead of nextjs but its good to know it exists. 

**So why does nextJS outgo react?** 

Before we get into all this I also want to conclude that Next JS is react as well but with a new set of configured webpack settings so developers don't cry about the `Bundle size` in the production build and the time it takes to load on the page reload.

### How does nextjs handle bundle size in production? 

Instead of making one huge bundle, they make multiple separate bundles which belongs to specific route. So when a user requests for a page, they only get the JavaScript required for that page, By doing this we can overcome the time to takes to load content on the first load.

**For Example:** If a user is in route `about`, the server will only send the JavaScript module for that page. But in the react projects, when you load the project the server sends the entire bundle and it starts rendering in front of the client. This is why react projects take forever to load. 
So what people do is( For big application ), they do something called `code splitting` so that client does get the entire module which could take minutes to load. Next js does this outta the box.

## Lets talk about the 3 different types of rendering. 

- Client Side Rendering 
- Static Site Generation
- Server Side Rendering 

### Client Side Generation? 

`If you are familiar with React, you should know it uses client side rendering.`

In this type of generation, the server sends the entire JavaScript to the client and in front of the client the page starts to render. 

**Life Cycle:**  

```
 > User Request for the page. 
       > The CSS, And the JavaScript is sent. 
              > Takes time to download the JavaScript.
                     > Once the JavaScript is downloaded by the browser, the html gets rendered and page is intractable.

```

### Static Site Generation? 

Like the name sounds this is used more with static sites which there isn't a need for building the site again and again. 
So basically what nextJS does in static site generation is, on build time the static page gets generated into html and js. So when a user requests for the page, 
ans its static, the server will blinding just send the html and js since the page is static so it doesn't need to remake the entire page. This can save a lot of speed and time
since the server doesn't need to remake the site and stuff.

NextJS has a extra feature to this. You can set a time interval to it, so even thought you page is static, it remakes everything in the interval. 

> Mostly used for blogs and other static pages that are not interactive. 

**Life Cycle:**  

```
> On the build time the page is built
       > When site gets requested the page is sent. The server sends the required JS (Which is very less in this case), CSS and HTML. 
              > Page is generated right after requested, you might need to wait a tiny about before it gets interactive but most static sites aren't interactive except for some hyperlinks, so JS isn't intensively used here.
                     > So in this case the page is sent on request and is already built on build time, this means the page doesn't need to be built the content in server or client. 

```

### Server Side Generation? 

Server side generation is similar to client side generation but instead the page gets generated on the server and then gets sent to the client.
This was how web was done before react. This can be slow sometimes so its better to use Client side generation but it also depends on the situation.
In this methods. for each page request, the server makes the entire page again and then sends it to the client. This can get really costly at times. 

**Life Cycle:**  

```
> User Request for the page. 
       > The content is built on the server on request.
              > Sends the CSS, JavaScript, and HTML. 
                     > So on request, you will immediately see the content on the page since HTML is sent, however it takes time before the page is interactive since the browser javascript needs to be downloaded.
