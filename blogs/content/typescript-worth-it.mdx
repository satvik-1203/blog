# Is TypeScript really worth it?

I see many people saying typescript isn't worth it or too hard to learn, **its completely wrong**.


### Why do I say this? 

At first like anyone, I thought TypeScript isn't worth it and will take me back to writing JAVA, which is not what I wanted. 
But again if you used JavaScript before, you know it yourself that `Can't read the property of undefined` which might 
trigger many of you when your testing your code and its so hard trying to debug cuz finding the type errors across your 
take almost forever. 

Trust me if you know JavaScript, TypeScript will be very easy to adapt to, at first it might feel scary to keep types everywhere 
and TS shouting at you that it's not an assigned type but once you get a hang of it, its very handy and JavaScript can feel scary ðŸ˜‚. 
Every JS code is also TS code so if you want to disable the strict checking, you can just configure it in `tsconfig.json` or just use `any`
type to make it plain JS type.

### Why I use TS? 

Using TypeScript is like, `Choose if you want to write code faster or spend less time while debugging.` I'll agree, using TypeScript at 
times isn't the best solution, cuz it's a headache to keep types for almost every variable, but trust me, while scaling you application
or working
